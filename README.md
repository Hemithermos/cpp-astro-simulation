This project is heavily inspired by the great work of Kavan in his video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-B6ryuBkCM&t=96s

## 1 - switch to ECS

Built the ECS library from scratch from the website : <hlink>https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/</hlink>


## 2 - implement physics

Lensing in 2D is physically implemented using the Schwartzschild metric and the null geodesic.

## 3 - OpenGL and glfw

Learning shaders funny things right now.

## 4 - enjoy 3d shenanigans

Far from even trying right now
